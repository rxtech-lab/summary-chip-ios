# CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION is overridden per-build so every CI build has a unique
# build number (github.run_number), without committing churn to project.pbxproj.
# Provisioning profiles are pinned per target by set-provisioning-profiles.sh,
# NOT passed on the command line. CODE_SIGN_STYLE/IDENTITY stay global: Manual
# signing needs no Apple ID on the runner and package targets sign with the
# identity but need no profile.
#
# --timestamp makes codesign contact Apple's secure timestamp service, which
# intermittently answers "The timestamp service is not available." and fails the
# whole archive with exit 65. Dropping --timestamp is not an option (notarization
# requires a secure timestamp), so retry instead. xcodebuild is incremental, so a
# retry only re-runs the CodeSign commands that failed.
